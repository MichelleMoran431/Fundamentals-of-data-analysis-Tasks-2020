    "\n",
    "It is important to consider the data types to be examined. In terms of strings , they may need to be preprocessed prior to been counted. By Preprocessed , I mean removing spaces , making the string in the same cases ( either uppercase or lowercase). Also if we are using boolean expressions in the same list , these must be positioned last in the list in order to be counted.  Below is example of this : \n",
    "\n",
    "A limitation to this function is the data types /elements contained in the list. For example , if our list contain one type of element , either a string ( lower case or higher case elements) or integers or even boolean expressions then the function would work. The arrangement of the data types in the list is important also. For example if there are integers /string elements before a boolean expressions , than the function would output a correct count. However if they were arrangement after the boolean expression , then the python output would be incorrect. That is in python , the True expression counts as 1 and the False expression counts as 0. \n",
    "In Code example no. 2  we have included various data types in list and also created the function count(). Count() can be used to count the number of times a word occurs in a string or in other words it is used to tell the frequency of a word in a string.
