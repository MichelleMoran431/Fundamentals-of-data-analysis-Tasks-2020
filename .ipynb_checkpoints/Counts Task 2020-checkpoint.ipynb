    "###### Task Details : \n",
    "\n",
    "Write a Python function called counts that takes a list as\n",
    "input and returns a dictionary of unique items in the list as keys and the number of\n",
    "times each item appears as values\n",
    "\n",

    "###### Background Research:\n",
    "\n",
    "Most efficient way to count the frequency in python would be to use the collections module. It has a number of commonly ised data structures from the python collections module , one such is COUNTER. It returns a dictionary containing keys and its values which is unordered but within COUNTER , there is additional functions to overcome this. \n",
    "\n",
    "However in accordance with task there are different Ways in Python to count words without the use of any modules  : \n",
    "\n",
    "1.For loop :where the number of spaces between the two characters are counted\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Split() : by removing the spaces from the start and end, breaking every word whenever encountered a space and storing them in a list. The length (len) of the list is the total count of words.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different Ways in Python to  count the frequency of words  in a string : \n",
    "\n",
    "1.Initializing a dictionary to store the frequency of words. Curly brackets defines a dictionary and square brackets accesses things within it. The keys operation returns a list of keys that are defined in the dictionary. Code example 1 below using list given in task\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Count() can be used to count the number of times a word occurs in a string or in other words it is used to tell the frequency of a word in a string. We just need to pass the word in the argument. Code example 2 below using list given in task\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Development : \n",
    "\n",
    "When considering using count() or any other method , it is important to consider the data types to be examined. In terms of strings , they may need to be preprocessed prior to been counted. By Preprocessed , I mean removing spaces , making the string in the same cases ( either uppercase or lowercase). \n",
